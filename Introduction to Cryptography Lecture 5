Protocol for a password 

Protocol for static biometric 

protocol for a token 

protocl for dynamic biometric 

For quiz will be weeks 1-3
secure design principles, user authentication and cryptography 

midterm will be all of this + week 4 and a little bit of week 5

quiz will be short answers

midterm will be a lot of different questions and kind of hard

cryptography - the art of secret writing 
plain text ---encryption---->ciphertext-------decryption---->plain text

cryptography can be broken, it's not a "never to be hacked" but more so a "not anytime soon"

messages are in plain text then to cipher text 

ingredients consist of algorithms and keys 

the players of cryptography are cryptogrpaher inventing crypto algorithms and cryptoanalyst is so one who breaks the algroithsm and discovers it 

plain text - the original message in their nroaml readable form, 

crytography - algorithm, it's okay for it to be public! supports open design principle. an algorithm without the key cannot untangle the information 
from the ciphertext

computational issues - algorithm 

publication issues - 
public or secret? its OKAY for it to be public, sunlight is the best disinfectant
military algorithsm are kept private 

Caesar encryption 
substitute letter 3 letters further on 
DOZEN -> 

for a key of one for decryption - you'd go back a letter in the alphabet 

using relative frequency of letters in english text, e being the the most common letter 
you can see what character is most common, may be e
first step toward decrypting 


decrypting methods 
if you only have cipher text, you'd look at all possible keys and you'd need a long cipher text so it'd give you more room to guess - easier to narrow down 

if you have known plaintext, check cipher text and plain text pairs 

type of cryptography 

public key - commonly used for encryption
two keys public and private 

symmetric key - aka secret key - commonly used for encryption
one key - secret but maybe shared 
both parties are familiar with the key 
use the same key to encrypt and decrypt 
"move forwards one step - encrypt, move back one step - decrypt"
transmission over insecure channel
authentication - strong authentication proves knowledge of who you are without revealing the key ??

assymmtric cryptography - unconventional cryptography 
Public key" publichsed, ideally known widleu 
private key (NOT secret key): not publicshed 
you will rely on the recievers public key and private key 
the reason why it works its becayse of how the public and private key are generated
how come alice will recieve the same messsages if she doesn't use the same key that is publicy shared with bob?
encryption is using the public key 
decryption is using your private key 

public key cryptography issues 
efficiency 
- public key cryptographic algorithms are orders of magnitute slower than simmetric key algorithms 

hybrid model 
- public key used to establish tempprary 

hash functions - providing user based authentication 
no keys 
digital signatures also used assymetric crypto 
signature can only be generated by owne/knower of private key 
signature can be verified by anyone via public key 
security goal - non repudiation goal - sender cannot prove message (signature) was not sent 
private key is used fr encyrption 
public key is used for decryption - different than previous assymmetry example
