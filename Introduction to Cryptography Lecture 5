cryptography - the art of secret writing 
plain text ---encryption---->ciphertext-------decryption---->plain text

cryptography can be broken, it's not a "never to be hacked" but more so a "not anytime soon"

messages are in plain text then to cipher text 

ingredients consist of algorithms and keys 

the players of cryptography are cryptogrpaher inventing crypto algorithms and cryptoanalyst is so one who breaks the algroithsm and discovers it 

plain text - the original message in their nroaml readable form, 

crytography - algorithm, it's okay for it to be public!
