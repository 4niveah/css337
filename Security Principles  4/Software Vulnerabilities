imperfect software 
programmer typically intends his code to manipulate 


software vulnerability 
any input dependent bug that can cause program to complete operations that deviate from programmers intent 
ex. dangling pointers

most common type are memory safety violations which consist buffer overflows and dangling pointers
also input validation errors 
privilege confusion bugs - cross site request forgery

buffer overflow vulnerability

take some input that it writes into a pre-allocated buffer 
the developer forgets to check that the size of the input isn't larger than the size of the buffer 

buffer overflow attack is very common in C and C++

not a new problem but any means <- still a major security problem 

validating input, checking input 
avoiding insecure functions -> strcpy(), strcat(), printf(), gets()

use of dynamic memory allocattion

format string vulnerabillity 
any function using a format string 
wha does %x do? %s? %n?

printf(%a) 
it will rewrite to a another address? not always throw an error, it will rewrite the data 

what can you do? 
always specify a format string as part od program not as an input 

integer security
integer range checking has not been systematically applied in the development of most C, 


intger overflow 
-2^n-1 to 2^n-1 -1 

truncation error example
