user authentication - monday april 7th 
- verifying that you are who you say you are

MAC - message authentication codes
- verifying that the message is intact 

what are the many ways we authenticate ourselves?
- fingerprint 
- security questions 
- face ID

4 ways of authenticating useres 
- based on something the indiviual knows - password, PIN seurity, questions
- something that the individual posesses - token, smartcard, physical key
- something the indiviual is - fingerprint, retina, face 
- something the individual does - voice pattern, handwriting, typing, rhythm 

risk assessment for user authentication 
- assurance level: the degree of certainty that a user has presented a credential that refers to his/her identity
- Level 1: little confidence (online forum) to Level 4: very high confidencce (employees accessing highly sensitive data)

common defense 
- user provides user id and password and then checkes it with the one stored for that specified userID 

lots of password vulnerabilities
- offline dictionary attack 
+ an attack where you check from passwords found in a dictionary 
+ hashing technique - a way to mask your password, you send a text , run it thorugh hashing algorithm, produces a set of digits
