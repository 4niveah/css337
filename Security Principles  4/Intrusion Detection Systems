Intrusion Detection Systems 

first line of defense is the firewall --------
you can decide which packets are denied or allowed 

can monitor all traffic entering and leaving the private network and alert the IT staff to any attempts to circumvent security or patterns 
of inappropriate use 

cryptographic + firewall (intrusion prevention systems) is FIRST line of defense 

limitation intrusion prevention systems 
- not all access to the internet occurs though the firewall
- firewalls don't inspect the content of the permitted traffic 
- cryptographic measures annot protect against insider attacks 
- 

insider attacs 
- among the most difficult to detect and prevent 
- can be motivated by revenge 

intruder behavior 
target acquisition and information gathering 
information gathering or system exploit 
initial access 
maintaing access 
privilege escalation 
covering tracks 

prevent -> detect -> survive

IDS - intrusion detection systems 
a systems second line of defense 

types of intrusion detection systems 
-> host-based IDS (HIDS) monitor single host activity 
-> Network - based (NIDS) monitor network traffic 
-> Distributed or hybrid: Combines information from a number of sensors, often
both host and network based, in a central analyzer that is able to better identify
and respond to intrusion activity


components of IDS 
traffic ollecor/ sensor 

HIDS this could be log files, audi logs or traffic coming to or leaving a aspecific system 
NIDS this is typically a mechanism for copying traffic off a network traffic link 

anaylis engine - brain of IDS


signature database - 
has a collection of patterns and defintions of known suspcious or malicious activity 
has a diary of all the bad things that can happen 


user interface and reporting - 


advantages of NIDS 
requires fewer systems 
maintenance costs are usually lower 


disadvanatges of NIDS 
it is ineffective when traffic is encrypted 
it only looks at network level traffic 
it has to handle high volumes of traffic 

advantage of HIDS - host based system 
can be operating system specific 
can reduce false-positive rate 
can examine data after it has been decrypted 
can be specific to application 
you can get VERY specific - how it impacts your system 


disadvantage of HIDS 
high cost of ownership and maintenance 
have to process information on every system you want to watch 
can't relate activity around it 
if it's logged locally, could be a vulnerability 

TYPES OF IDS 
signature based - used the signature database, list of attackks that have already happened 
"misuse detection"
where you have all the database of attack patterns 
applies set of patterns and rules 
needs to be updated and if software isn't updated - it can be vulnerable 


anomly based (heuristic) - 
builds a profile or what is a "normal" profile 
if there is an deviation from normal behavior 
downside is if its true or not 
advantage - able to detect unknown, zero-day attacks 
downside - high-false positive rate, trained on legitamate data NOT malicious data so it limites the effectiveness
