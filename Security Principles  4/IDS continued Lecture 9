IDS principles 

assumes malicious behavior is much different than normal user behavior 
this brings problems of false positives, false negatives - you have to compromise!!

loose interpretation means you classify everything as an attack 
more false positives 

tight interpretation - 
the opposite 
more false negatives 

true positives MATTER MOST - if there is an attack, you want it in order to grab the data 

False positives - in industry this is important, because it costs more to have a syste administrator navigating things that aren't real 

Professor geetha does a lot of IDS research as well as machine learning 

differences between IDS and IPDA 
IDS tools are only capable of detecting intrusions, IPS tools can actively prevent them as well 
IDS toold are restrcited to detecting threats, while IPS tools can both detect and prevent them 

IDS tools send alerts when a threat is detected
