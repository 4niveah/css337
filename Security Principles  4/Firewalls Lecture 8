wanted their internal networks to be protected form the external world 
want to prevent unauthorized sources to get access to systems 

computers and networks are online all the time
attackers are constantly scanning the things to see 

bunp-in-the-wire - a separate hardware based firewall 
bum-in-the-stack - implementing a firewall as a software, no explicit device
bastian host firewall or sacrifical host - stands guard along the path of potential attack and takes the brunt of any attack

makes sure software is updated as much as possible 

if your firewall goes offline, everything is up for grabs 

 a lot of filtering and blocking based on packet 

VPN - virtual private networks 

firewall configuratons 
- multi-homed firewall 
--multiple interfaces, ex. connecting to internet, web server, and internal network 
- DMZ - demilitarized zone, 
-- systems that are externally accesible with some external connectivity but need additional protections across DMZ networks 

security policy and firewall rules 
no outside web access - drop all outgoing packets to any IP address, port 80

how do you translate security policy into a firewall settings?

firewalls enforce network security policy 


firewalls follow "deny by default/allow by exception"

deny by default - assume that all traffic is coming in is malicious traffic 
authorized traffic is identified - grants access to networks 
less burden on administrator 


if your organziation does now have rules - LETI
Defining firewall rules is an essential part of a security policy
If the policy does not predefine rules, perform the following procedure:
1. Inventory all essential business processes and communications that will cross the
firewall/checkpoint
2. Determine the protocols, ports, and Internet Protocol (IP) addresses of valid traffic
for both internal and external hosts
3. Write out the rules or use a firewall rule designer/simulator
4. Test the rules in a safe, nonproduction environment
5. Obtain written approval for the rule sets from a change approval board or
administration
6. Document the rules in a security policy procedure amendment and submit the
amendment to the security policy management team or administrator for inclusion
in the official document


common types of rules found on most firewalls 
-- acess to insecure internet websites 
--access to secure internet websites 
--access to other internet website protocols 
-inbound internet email
-outbound internet email 

composing firewall rules 
base protocol 
source address
source port 
target address - where is it going?
target port 
action 
a lot of things are packet filetering firewalls - relies heavily on IP address

outbound rules!!!

port 80 - insecure websites 
port 443 - https secure website
port 21 - FTP internert based sited

port 25 - email server 

once you decide on security policy for an organization - you have to decide on basic (TCP) rules set 
the rules are sequential - they can't be mixed up 

when composing firewall rulles 
- keep the rule set as simple as possible 
-document every rule 
- use a chnage control mechanism to track rule modifications 
- always confirm default deny 






default allow - assumes most trafic is not malicious or benign
