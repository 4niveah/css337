Thinking about Security 

Models
Security Models 
a scheme for defining and enforcing security policies 
only the teacher can chnage grades
students can only view grade assigned to them 

threat models 

all the systems are primarily concerned with security and correctness
"give good input, give good output"

no encryption does any good, someone will make a mistake

attackers, has value for various abilities to control other people's assets
learn about where you live, steal your credit card indo 
disrupts honest's user use of the system
network security prospective - attacker intercepts and controls network communication 
web security - attacker sets up malicious site visited by victim; no control of network 
operating system security = controls malicious files and application

defender 
protects assents 
prevents attacker from gaining values 

CIA Goals 
Confidentiality.
Data is only accessed by those authorized to access
attacker cannot learn alice's secrets 

Integrity.
Data is remains accurate, consistent, and unaltered
attack cannot corrupt alice's data

Availability. 
Data is accessible to authorized users when needed 
- DoS attacks restrict availbility 

You can purchase hacker attacks on bank acounts, credit cards, full identity, email passwords/addresses, for less than $20 - very scary 
health data can be accessed for $100-$400 

Why are there security vulnerabilities?
There are more attack services - bluetooth 
User awareness 
Insecure code 


In this class:
How to run security tools 
How to "hack"


Due next week:
Kali VM
for newer macs there will be more instructions added
